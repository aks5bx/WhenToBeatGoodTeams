# WhenToBeatGoodTeams

## Project Overview 
In early November, Syracuse Men's Basketball coach Jim Boeheim claimed that early season ACC games were unfair and a "money grab" for the league (https://www.si.com/college/2019/11/07/jim-boeheim-rips-acc-following-season-opening-loss). 

Guiding this is a belief that when weak teams play top tier teams early on in the season, the weak teams are at a disadvantage. The argument is that top tier teams rely on talent, which is ready to go, whereas weaker teams rely on team cohesion and game film, which takes longer into the season to develop. (I don't really agree with this, but people claim this). 

## Findings
So, I decided to look into the numbers. Turns out, good teams (in this sample I choose 10 teams I found to be consistenty good over the last 10 years: Kansas, Duke, UNC, Kentucky, Syracuse, Villanova, Michigan, Michigan State, Louisville, and Gonzaga) actually do perform worse against unranked teams later in the season. In fact, there is a statistically significant decrease in these 10 teams' win % against unranked teams as the season progresses. You might have a point here, Jim. 

The graph below shows that top teams become more beatable as the season progresses.
